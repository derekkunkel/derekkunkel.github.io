Whole Node Songwriting Assistant
During the songwriting process, songwriters frequently find themselves with an abundance of song fragments, chord progressions, and other theoretical or aural musical inspirations with no effective means of documenting and organizing these elements. Tracking the progression of a song and documenting how it changes over time is a time-consuming process because it requires writers to continually organize their ever-expanding library of files. Often the user is forced to delete files containing plausible song iterations, or transfer their ideas to a different device, which makes it difficult to compare multiple versions of their song. Our solution to this problem is a system that provides version control for songwriters. Our system would use a tree structure to record the development of the project, which provides songwriters with easy access to their audio and text files. Additionally, this system would allow users to examine previous versions of their project and track the development of their work. Key features of this system would allow users to contain all the information of the song at that point in time (lyrics, audio recording, photos/videos of song being played, keyboard settings, etc). As well, this system would provide an audio recording interface that allows the user to have lyrics on their phone screen as they are recording their song iterations.
